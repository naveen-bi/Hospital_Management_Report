# Power BI Hospital Dashboard – Real-Time Insights for Patients, Doctors & Billing

## Objective
To design an interactive and integrated Power BI reporting solution that provides hospital stakeholders with real-time visibility into patient journeys, doctor performance, surgery outcomes, and billing summaries—leveraging SQL Server as the data backbone.

## Project Overview

A mid-sized multi-specialty hospital wanted to modernize its reporting ecosystem. Manual Excel-based reports were consuming time, prone to errors, and lacked a unified view of operations. The hospital aimed to empower staff and administrators with real-time dashboards that streamline decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

## Challenges

Data scattered across multiple systems (patients, billing, doctors, surgeries).

Time-consuming Excel reports with frequent delays and inaccuracies.

No consolidated view of patient care, doctor productivity, or revenue streams.

Inability to simulate billing and commission-based scenarios.

Limited visibility into appointment management and surgical schedules.

## Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard suite with four integrated reports:

1. Patient Report

Flip Card showing patient profile, status, and health metrics.

Interactive HTML billing summary with costs, discounts, and payments.

Tables for medication history, test results, and department details.

2. Doctor Report

Flip Card for doctor profile with appointment calendar.

What-If analysis for commission and earnings forecasting.

KPIs for earnings, patient volume, and appointment trends.

3. Surgery Report

Surgery calendar for scheduling and tracking.

Visual insights on surgery types, outcomes, and payment methods.

4. Billing Summary

HTML-based card for total charges, net payments, and discounts.

Dynamic visuals and KPIs highlighting top revenue contributors.

## Data Flow & Technology

SQL Server–based ETL for clean, structured data.

Star schema modeling with optimized DAX measures in Power BI.

Use of custom visuals including HTML cards and calendar views for enhanced user experience.

## Impact & Outcomes

Centralized reporting delivering real-time insights across patients, doctors, and finance teams.

Reporting time reduced by 80%, minimizing manual effort.

Data-driven decisions enabled for department heads and administrators.

Role-based access ensured personalized views for stakeholders.

Improved user experience through Flip Cards, What-If analysis, and calendar-based scheduling.

Operational efficiency enhanced, supporting smoother patient care and hospital management.
